## My name is Alan Doyle.

No, not this [Alan Doyle](https://alandoyle.ca). He can sing, I definitely canâ€™t!

First, and foremost, Iâ€™m a father to 2 beautiful daughters. Iâ€™m an Irish (Dublin born) Software Developer currently living in Birmingham, England. I hope to return to Ireland permenantly one day soon.

Iâ€™ve been a Software Developer for over 25 years now, initially working on embedded systems but currently writing cross-platform software to run on AIX, Linux, Open Server and Windows from a single common codebase for the Motor Trade.

My passion always was and always will be coding. Iâ€™ve been writing Software since I was 12 years old on the Commodore 64 my parents got me for Christmas, later I moved on to an Amiga 500 and Amiga 1200. However since I switched to PCs Iâ€™ve never been happy running Windows, I missed the passion Amiga coders had but now Iâ€™ve found that Open-Source software (particularly Linux) feeds that passion.

I regularly use many languages on a daily basisâ€¦

```
C, C++, C#, MFC, ASP.net, HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, SQL, MySQL, bash, Powershell... to name a few.
```

Iâ€™m not afraid to try other languages too and have been known to dabble in Python, Perl, Go and Rust.

Iâ€™ve written software for various flavours of Linux, as well as AmigaOS 1.x+, AIX 4.3+, SCO 4.2+ and all versions of Windows and DOS.

Here on Github you'll find my Windows, Linux and, hopefuly, my Amiga projects as I get time to clean them up and make them available.
